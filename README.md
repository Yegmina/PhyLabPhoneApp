## Project Overview

"Physics Lab in Your Phone" is an innovative game application that addresses the issue of limited access to specialized laboratory equipment for conducting physics experiments. Through this app, we turn an ordinary mobile phone into a powerful portable physics laboratory, making science accessible to everyone.

## Relevance of the Project

The project is particularly crucial in situations where access to laboratory equipment is restricted, such as during quarantines or wartime conflicts. In such conditions, a physics lab in the phone becomes a valuable tool for students and scholars.

## Key Features

- Utilization of built-in sensors in mobile devices.
- Physical simulations for demonstrating key physics concepts.
- Practical experiments to enhance understanding of physical laws.

## Educational Use

The app not only provides access to laboratory capabilities but also improves the understanding of physical concepts through practical investigations. Teachers can use it to demonstrate physical phenomena and laws, making learning more engaging for students.

## Video Tutorials

Video tutorials for some experiments are available on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCboaD23ldsinfPbKxjfI0ng).

## Application

The app is designed not only for students and scholars but also for teachers and anyone interested in physics and eager to explore it hands-on. "Physics Lab in Your Phone" makes learning more accessible and interesting, increasing the overall interest in science.

**Project Goal:** Creating an interactive application for learning physics using built-in sensors and physical simulations to make science more accessible and understandable.
